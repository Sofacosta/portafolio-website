      <p class="intro">Hello! Welcome to <strong>my first portfolio website</strong>. This is me in my studio in Portland, Oregon. One of my favorite places on earth where I have the chance to freely express and create by myself or with a group of people. This picture was taken by my friend Al Pomper in 2019.</p>

      <h2><span style="color: red;">Projects and concepts I have been learning on my firs week of programming school at Epicodus:</span></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Sofacosta/my-first-webpage">My first webpage</a> was created with my classmate Jeroen. We practice different concepts mostly HTML, navigating and making sure we understand Git and styling with a litle css</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jessicarubinwilliams/cupcake-website">Cupcake Website</a> was created with my classmate Jessica. Here we were able to practice documenting properly with README and styling with classes. I was able to learn more in depth how to navigate Git.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pingel88.github.io/animal-shelter-/">Animal Shelter Website</a> was created with my classmate Mike. We were able to practice Cascading and Debugging. Later in the day our classmate Sylvja joined us and we were able to practice debugging, although it was frustrating not finding a solution, we practice searching and patience :)</li>
